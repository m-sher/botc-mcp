# Multi-agent TUI harness

`botc-tui` is a **monitoring + orchestration** front-end for multi-model Trouble Brewing runs.

It:

1. Creates one shared in-process game (Storyteller authority).
2. Exposes that game over a **Unix-socket tool RPC**.
3. Spawns **N player + 1 host** headless [Grok Build](https://grok.x.ai) sessions.
4. Each session loads a project-scoped MCP config pointing at `botc-agent-mcp`, a stdio MCP proxy that injects that agent’s token and forwards tools to the shared engine.
5. Shows a **ratatui** board: agent list (with running/idle glyphs), a live **action feed** (every agent tool call, game actions highlighted) or host grimoire, and the selected agent's stream.

## Build

**Both binaries are required.** `botc-tui` spawns `botc-agent-mcp` as the per-agent MCP proxy; if the proxy is missing, agents start but cannot call tools.

```bash
cargo build --bins
# produces: target/debug/botc-tui  target/debug/botc-agent-mcp  target/debug/botc-mcp
```

Ensure `grok` is on your `PATH` (or `~/.grok/bin/grok`) and you are authenticated (`grok login` or `XAI_API_KEY`).

## Run

```bash
# Preferred: build all bins, then run the TUI
cargo build --bins
cargo run --bin botc-tui

# Or run the built binary directly (so sibling botc-agent-mcp is found next to it):
./target/debug/botc-tui
```

`cargo run --bin botc-tui` alone only ensures `botc-tui` is built. The TUI checks that `botc-agent-mcp` exists at launch and refuses to spawn agents with a clear error if it does not.

### Setup screen

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Player count 5–15 (**sessions = players + 1 host**) |
| `Enter` | Create game, start night 1, spawn Grok agents |
| `q` | Quit (kills Grok children and removes workdirs) |

### Monitor screen

Three columns — **left:** agents · **center:** live **action feed** (all agents) or host grimoire · **right:** the selected agent's raw stream. The **top bar** shows live progress: `phase · turn <who> · auto Ns / manual · running: <who>` — so you can always tell whether anything is actually running.

| Key / mouse | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` / **click agent** | Select agent stream (resets to live tail) |
| `Space` | Advance **one turn** — ticks only the agent(s) the engine is waiting on |
| `t` | Toggle auto-tick (~45s), which runs the same turn-routed step |
| `g` | Center pane: toggle **action feed ↔ host grimoire** |
| `f` | Feed filter: **all actions ↔ game-only** |
| `h` / **click stream** | Expand/collapse **thinking** for the selected agent (default: collapsed) |
| `PgUp`/`PgDn`/`↑`/`↓` / **wheel on stream** | Scroll selected agent log (away from / toward live tail) |
| `Home` | Jump to live tail |
| `q` | Kill agents, remove workdirs, stop socket, quit |

**Action feed.** Every agent tool call is recorded at the shared socket and shown here, newest at the bottom, labelled by caller (`Host` / `P0`…, colour-coded). **Game-affecting actions** (`say`, `nominate`, `vote`, `night_action`, `host_decide`, `close_vote`, …) are **highlighted** with a `▶` marker + bold tool name + cyan arg summary (e.g. `P3 ▶ vote →P1 YES ✓`); read-only inspection (`get_*_state`, `list_*`) is dimmed; errors are red. Press **`f`** to hide the info-read noise and show only game actions + errors. This is the fastest way to see *what agents are doing* (vs the per-agent stream, which shows their reasoning).

Per-agent **status glyph** in the left list: `●` green = a Grok child is running for that seat, `○` grey = idle.

**Stream pane:** the selected agent's raw output streams **live, token by token** (no
buffering until a block finishes) and is **coloured by kind** rather than tagged — model
text is default, **thinking is dim grey**, **stderr yellow**, and turn/error notices cyan/red.
Model thinking is **collapsed by default** (a one-line `· thinking… N line(s) …` stand-in) so
you see game-facing output first; **`h`** or **left-click the stream** expands that agent's
full thinking; again collapses. Expansion is **per agent**; the title shows `·think▾`/`·think▸`.
**Mouse wheel over the stream** scrolls history (same as PgUp/PgDn); wheel elsewhere is ignored.

## Turn order (scheduling)

Trouble Brewing is strictly **sequential**, so a tick does **not** wake every agent — it
routes to the agent(s) the engine is actually waiting on, with a targeted prompt
(`src/harness/scheduler.rs`, `plan_ticks`):

| Game state | Ticked this turn |
| --- | --- |
| Lobby | Host → `start_game` |
| Night, `pending_host` set | Host → resolve the Storyteller decision |
| Night, `pending_night` set | **only that seat** → its night action (targeted wake prompt) |
| Night, nothing pending | Host → advance the night machine |
| Day / Discussion | Host (pace / open nominations) + one living player (round-robin) |
| Day / Nominations, no open vote | Host (manage) + one living player (round-robin) to nominate |
| Day / Nominations, vote open | the eligible voters who haven't voted (host is **not** co-scheduled to close — it would race the votes) |
| Ended | nobody — auto-tick disarms |

**Stall escalation.** If the engine sits on the same wait for `STALL_ESCALATE` (3)
consecutive cycles — a woken player never submits its night action, or a vote stops
progressing — the plan adds a host fallback (`skip_night_action` for the stuck wake, or
`close_vote` for the stalled vote) so a non-acting agent can't wedge the game. Normal
turns route to only the responsible agent; the host override kicks in only after it
demonstrably fails to act.

The one-time **kickoff** still fans out to every agent (each introduces itself); ongoing
play is turn-routed. This is why, with the host driving, agents act on their turn instead
of all polling tools at once.

## Debug log

The TUI writes a **verbose, timestamped** trace to a file (the full-screen UI can't use
stdout). Default `/tmp/botc-tui-debug.log` (override with `BOTC_TUI_LOG`); the path is shown
in the status line at launch, and it survives quit (it is **not** under the deleted work root).

Each line is `[HH:MM:SS.mmm +elapsedms] …`. It records the state machine end to end:

- `LAUNCH` — game id, player count, ST mode, token count.
- `TICK` — every scheduler cycle: `sig` (what the engine waits on), `stall`, live `phase` /
  `pending_host` / `pending_night` / nomination state, and the routed `plan=[…]`.
- `SPAWN` / `EXIT` — per agent: resume-vs-fresh, session id, first prompt line, full argv;
  and on exit the code, whether the session was `established`, and any id regeneration.
  `SPAWN … SKIPPED` means the previous tick for that seat was still running.
- `RPC` — every tool call through the socket: `actor tool args=… -> ok/ERR`.

So a stuck host shows up plainly: e.g. repeated `TICK … plan=[Host]` with no following
`RPC Host …` means the host agent isn't calling tools; `SPAWN Host … SKIPPED` means its
previous tick never exited.

## Workdirs

Each agent gets `/tmp/botc-harness-<uuid>/{host,seat0,…}/`:

- `.grok/config.toml` — project MCP → `botc-agent-mcp --socket … --token-file … --game-id … --role …`
- `agent.token` — opaque seat/host secret (not shared across agents)
- `prompt.txt` — last kickoff/tick prompt

On quit (`q`) or process exit, the harness **kills** all Grok children and **removes** the work root (token files do not linger).

## Security notes

- Tokens are **never** put in another agent’s prompt or MCP config.
- Player proxies always inject their own token; they cannot escalate to host unless given the host token file.
- Role ACL in `botc-agent-mcp` denies host-only tools for player agents (JSON-RPC `-32602`).
- The TUI process holds the real grimoire for monitoring only.

## Limitations (v1)

- Agents are driven by **periodic headless ticks** (`grok --prompt-file … --resume`), not a single eternal ACP connection.
- Auto-approve uses a **single** flag (`--yolo`). Do not also pass `--always-approve` (same clap option → CLI error).
- A tick is skipped per agent if the previous Grok process for that seat is still running.
- First-run success is required before `--resume` is used; a failed kickoff retries with a fresh `--session-id`.
- Host-first Storyteller pauses require the **host** Grok agent (or skip defaults via host tools) to resolve night info.
- Cost: N+1 model sessions, but the turn-router ticks only the 1–2 agents whose turn it is (plus a fan-out during an open vote), not all N+1 each cycle.
- Ticks are **turn-routed** (see *Turn order*), so the night is sequential; day discussion/voting still allows a few agents per cycle, and the engine is mutex-serialized, so conflicting day actions are still possible during discussion but no longer the default.
- Progression depends on the **host** agent driving phase transitions (open/close nominations, advance the night); if it stalls, press `Space` to re-tick or resolve via host tools.

## Tests
